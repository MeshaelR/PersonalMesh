Welcome to my new website!

I will be using this website to primarily update what I am doing at University, my projects, and my current extracurricular education outside of class.

There will be much more filling and delicious gossip on this website regarding my past work very soon. Up until then thank you for stopping by! Please remember to tell me what you thought about this website and how I will be able to make it better.

This website is hosted on GitHub and is being supported through Jekyll. A lot of the source code has also been forked from PanosSakkos so thanks to him for an amazing base to work upon.

Don't be afraid of email harvesting, write your email properly and the page will perform javascript obfuscation.
