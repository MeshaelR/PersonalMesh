## About

Pursuing a degree in Engineering at McMaster University. A highly enthusiastic analytical thinker and problem solver, lover of all things electronic and mechanical. I passionately seek out knowledge, leadership opportunities and creating life long connections with colleagues.

Soon to have completed first year, I am looking forward to opportunities that allow me to apply my knowledge into practical scenarios. Specifically, working and learning among seasoned engineers and data/market research.
